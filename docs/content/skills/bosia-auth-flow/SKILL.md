description: Login + register + logout + forgot-password — Bun.password (NOT argon2 npm package), session cookie, RBAC bootstrap, public route group. Already-signed-in visitors bounce off /login and /register to the dashboard. A login page always ships alongside its post-login destination (no orphan auth). Spans multiple files. Uses Bun.password not argon2 npm package.

# bosia-auth-flow

A full auth surface wired to Drizzle + session cookies.

## Files

- `features/auth/password.ts` — Argon2id hash + verify via `Bun.password`
- `features/auth/tokens.ts` — session token mint + verify (opaque random 32 bytes, base64url)
- `features/auth/session-resolver.ts` — resolve session → `locals.user`, `locals.can`
- `features/auth/auth-handle.ts` — hook wiring the resolver into every request
- `(public)/login/+page.{svelte,server.ts}` — form + `actions` (validate, verify, set cookie, redirect)
- `(public)/register/+page.{svelte,server.ts}` — validate, hash, insert user, RBAC bootstrap, redirect
- `(public)/forgot/+page.{svelte,server.ts}` — request reset, mint token, email (or log in dev)
- `logout/+server.ts` — `POST` clears cookie, 303 to `/login` (action-only → `+server.ts`, see bosia-routing R2)

## Workflow

1. Confirm Drizzle `users` table has `passwordHash`; if not, add a numbered seed/migration — never edit applied seeds (bosia-drizzle-feature).
2. Install UI: `bosia add theme/neutral ui/form ui/field ui/input ui/button ui/label ui/alert`.
3. `password.ts` — see R1.
4. `tokens.ts`, `auth-handle.ts` (reads `session` cookie, loads user + materialized permissions, sets `locals.user`/`locals.can`).
5. Routes: login, register, forgot, logout — each `+page.server.ts` validates input and returns field errors via `fail()`.
6. RBAC bootstrap on register (R6). Then run bosia-security-review.

## Rules

R1 — Password hashing: `Bun.password.hash(pw, { algorithm: "argon2id", memoryCost: 19456, timeCost: 2 })` and `Bun.password.verify(pw, hash)`. NEVER `@node-rs/argon2`/`argon2`/`bcrypt` npm packages (NAPI bindings crash under Bun); never plain SHA / unsalted. See [[bosia-bun-runtime]].

R2 — Cookie flags: `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/`, `Max-Age=<ttl>` (first three are defaults). OMIT `secure` in route code — Bosia adds `Secure` per-request only on HTTPS; a literal `secure: true` on HTTP transport triggers a downgrade+warn and a silent login loop. See [[bosia-cookies]].

R3 — Validate at the boundary: form actions parse `formData` and validate (zod/hand), reject with field-level errors, no silent coercion.

R4 — Rate limit `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot` per-IP and per-account (dev bypass only).

R5 — No info leakage: login failure is a generic "Invalid credentials" (never "email exists but wrong password"). `/forgot` always responds "if the address exists, we sent a reset" regardless of existence.

R6 — RBAC bootstrap: first registered user (or `001_rbac_bootstrap.ts` seed) creates `super_admin` with `*.*` and self-assigns. Later users default to no role; super-admin assigns via UI.

R7 — Logout is POST (GET logout is a CSRF hole): `<form method="POST" action="/logout">` + `+server.ts`.

R8 — Post-auth redirect is server-side: `throw redirect(303, …)` from the form action. NEVER return `{ success: true }` then `goto()`/`window.location` inside `use:enhance` — the action's `Set-Cookie` can race the client nav, so the first request lands WITHOUT the session cookie and bounces back to `/login` (silent loop). For post-redirect UI state, encode it in the redirect URL or read `locals.user` at the destination.

R9 — Bounce signed-in visitors off `/login` and `/register`. In `+page.server.ts` (NOT the layout — login is `(public)`):

```ts
// src/routes/(public)/login/+page.server.ts
import { redirect, type LoadEvent } from "bosia";
export async function load({ locals }: LoadEvent) {
	if (locals.user) throw redirect(303, "/dashboard");
	return {};
}
```

Mirror in `(public)/register/+page.server.ts`. Target must match R8's so the loop is symmetric.

R10 — A login page implies a dashboard page. When you scaffold `(public)/login/+page.svelte`, also scaffold the post-login landing (typically `(private)/dashboard/+page.svelte`) plus `(private)/+layout.server.ts` gating the group (`if (!locals.user) throw redirect(303, "/login")`). Otherwise R8's redirect 404s and login looks broken. The dashboard can start minimal (heading + Log out form) but must exist.

Page loaders under that group start at the same time as the layout loader, so the layout redirect decides the response but does not stop the page `load()` from running. Keep page loaders free of side effects, and read `locals.user` defensively there (`locals.user?.id`), or `await parent()` before touching it.

## Checklist gate

P0:

- [ ] Argon2id hashing, never SHA-only.
- [ ] Session cookie `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax` (Secure added per-request, not literal).
- [ ] Generic login error; `/forgot` response identical regardless of email existence.
- [ ] Logout is `POST` via `+server.ts`.
- [ ] Login/register redirect via server-side `throw redirect(303, …)` — never `use:enhance` + client `goto()`.
- [ ] `(public)/login` and `(public)/register` `+page.server.ts` redirect signed-in visitors to the dashboard (R9).
- [ ] Post-login destination exists + `(private)/+layout.server.ts` gates the group (R10).
- [ ] All form actions validate input at the boundary.
- [ ] bosia-security-review pass.

P1:

- [ ] Rate limit on `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot`.
- [ ] Optional 2FA hook; email verification (or marked deferred).
- [ ] Password rules enforced (min length, common-password block).
